Recommended workaround is to locate Studio workspace so as to reduce the length of relative pathname references between Studio workspace location (where customer application resides) and Studio installation location (where Gecko SDK resides).\n  Bug fix: An invalid value of EMBER_AF_PLUGIN_IAS_ZONE_SERVER_ZONE_TYPE is generated by AppBuilder\n           A fix was made in AppBuilder to generate a correct value for C macro definition EMBER_AF_PLUGIN_IAS_ZONE_SERVER_ZONE_TYPE, based on the setting of the Zone Type option in the EmberZNet IAS Zone Server plugin.

Previously, the value for this macro definition was invalid, causing a compilation error and requiring a manual edit to correct.\n  Bug fix: \"Launch Console\" (silink.exe) cannot be started again after stopping a debug session\n           If a debug session is started using a WSTK and then the Device Console tool is launched, the console tool works correctly. However if the debug session is ended, then the Device Console cannot be made functional again without restarting Simplicity Studio.\n           This issue will be fixed in an upcoming patch release of Simplicity Studio V5.\n  Bug fix: DMP SED project doesn't generate when BLE and micrium OS SDKs were installed\n           The EmberZNet SDK's dynamic multi-protocol (DMP) sample applications rely on the Micrium OS and BLE SDKs also being installed. If those SDKs are not installed, the DMP sample applications are still presented as options. Attempting to create a DMP sample application may appear to complete, but subsequently will fail to generate because of unresolved dependencies on those SDKs. Subsequently installing those SDKs may not resolve the issues in that existing DMP sample application project. Be sure to install the Micrium OS and BLE SDKs before attempting to create an EmberZNet DMP sample application project.\n  Bug fix: DMP SED project doesn't create when BLE and micrium OS SDKs are missing\n           The EmberZNet SDK's dynamic multi-protocol (DMP) sample applications rely on the Micrium OS and BLE SDKs also being installed. If those SDKs are not installed, the DMP sample applications are still presented as options. Attempting to create a DMP sample application project can fail to complete, with no explicit indication about the missing SDKs. Subsequently installing those SDKs may not resolve the issues in that existing DMP sample application project, if it was created.
